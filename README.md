GitHub getting started tutorial/how-to

Hello GitHub world!

I thought I would create this GitHub to document my coding while I return to school. 
Going into the world of Compuer Science, which means programming and math. Like some of
you in the STEAM field; programming initally was not something I could get. It wasn't 
like most other languages to me (spoken languages) and was completely turned-off because
I just couldn't get it. Now I see that the world has always run on software and is mainly
about the software, so that brings me to here. 

So I am writing this to begin my journey and following the GitHub 'create-a-repository'
tutorial. I plan on using this to store my soon-to-come coding projects/homework and
collaborating with fellow students. 

Cheers,
ec
